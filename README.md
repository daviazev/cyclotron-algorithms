# Welcome!

This is a project created for the junior full-stack developer position application at [Lexart Labs](https://lexartlabs.com/).

## Algorithm Objective

The objective of this algorithm is to circulate a particle within a cyclotron. The particles used are: e (electron), p (proton), and n (neutron). Each particle has a circulation function within the cyclotron, which can create either a closed or an open loop.

## Technologies Used

The project was implemented using Python.

## How to Run

There are 2 options to see the code running:

### Installing the Repository (Python 3 required)

- Install the repository with the command `git clone git@github.com:daviazev/cyclotron-algorithms.git`
- Navigate to the folder using the command `cd cyclotron-algorithms`
- Run the command `python3 index.py`

### Without Installation

You can see the code running on [Replit](https://replit.com/@daviazevdo/algorithms-exercises-lexart-test#main.py). Simply access the link and click on "Run."
